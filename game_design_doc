Game Description: Eco-Political Gridiron (EPG)

Take the Helm, GM Harris!

What is "Eco-Political Gridiron (EPG)"?
"Eco-Political Gridiron (EPG)" is a unique, narrative-driven, single-player browser game that thrusts you into the high-stakes role of General Manager for the iconic Philadelphia Eagles NFL team. It's more than just football; EPG masterfully blends strategic team management with the complex, often-colliding worlds of political philosophy and environmental responsibility.

As GM Jake Harris, you'll navigate a full NFL season, making critical decisions that shape not only your team's on-field success but also its public image, internal cohesion, and ecological footprint. The game challenges you to:
Scout and Recruit Unique Talent: Go beyond typical player stats. In EPG, players embody distinct "Player-Philosophies" – from the "Individualist Maverick" who thrives on solo brilliance, to the "Egalitarian Workhorse" who champions team unity, and the "Traditionalist Bulwark" who values time-honoured strategies. Your ability to identify these philosophies (including through a fun "Real or Ringer?" NFL player name guessing mini-game) and integrate them into a winning team is paramount.
Navigate Complex Scenarios: Face thought-provoking dilemmas that mirror real-world challenges. Will you back a star player's controversial political statement? How will you respond to calls for costly but crucial environmental upgrades to the stadium? Your choices will have tangible consequences on team morale, fan loyalty, your Green Rating, and your reputation as a leader.

Manage Team Dynamics: Balance the often-conflicting viewpoints of your philosophically diverse players. Foster synergy or risk internal strife that spills onto the field.
Make Strategic Game-Day Calls: While the core game simulation is text-based, your strategic choices before and during games—influenced by your players' unique philosophical strengths and weaknesses—will determine victory or defeat.
Shape Your Legacy: Will you be known as a progressive eco-warrior, a pragmatic fiscal conservative, a master of philosophical harmony, or a ruthless winner at all costs? Your decisions sculpt your GM reputation across multiple spectrums.

Inspired by the deep character interactions and meaningful choices of games like Mass Effect, and the satisfying team-building and strategic layers of sports management sims, EPG aims to provide an engaging, thought-provoking, and personalised experience.

Why Was EPG Created? Who is it For?
EPG is a passion project, meticulously designed and brought to life by Dean Watkin as a special, personalised gift for his good friend, Jake Harris.
The primary audience is Jake Harris himself. The game is intricately tailored to his known interests: his love for NFL football (especially his favourite team, the Philadelphia Eagles, whom he gets to manage!), his appreciation for political philosophy, his keen interest in environmentalism, and his background as an ex-professional cricketer and a former video game designer (elements cleverly woven into the GM's character and abilities within the game). Every mechanic, every theme, every nod to sports and strategy has been considered with Jake in mind, aiming to create an experience that resonates deeply and provides hours of unique enjoyment.

While deeply personal in its conception for Jake, EPG also explores themes that will appeal to anyone who enjoys:
Strategic decision-making with real consequences.
Sports management sims with a unique twist.
Narrative-driven games that explore complex social and ethical issues.
The intriguing intersection of diverse ideologies.
EPG is more than just a game; it's a testament to friendship, a creative exploration of fascinating themes, and a unique journey into the heart of what it means to lead in a complex modern world – all through the engaging lens of NFL football. Prepare to think, strategise, and perhaps even see the gridiron in a whole new light!

The simulation needs to feel like it is a representation of the two teams that are playing each other such that the team with the better stats is more likely to win.  The player needs to feel like they are having an impact on the game with their decisions.
